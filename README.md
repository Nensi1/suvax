<h3> Distribution & Logistics Managament System </h3>
<i> Small-Medium Businesses </i>

A reaching set of management instruments for dealing with the whole work process of a medium-sized distribution company, with a specific focus in making it as user-friendly as possible both for the customer and the company. 

<b>Reason of choice</b> 

The motivation for chosing this software system idea, was the specific request from an already-established company of such kind. It was expressed that in the existing market there is only one provider of this system and it is more oriented to very large-sized companies, hence  it offers an overcomplicated design. 
This type of business is pretty dependent from labor work, thus our approach will be user-experience oriented, facilitating the process for workers that may not have such experience with applications such as drivers or warehouse employees, additionally adding a value to the performace measurement by the manager.
